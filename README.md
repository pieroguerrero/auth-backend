## General Information
- This project was created to fullfil the need several Software Engineers have when trying to create a Fullstack Web project from scratch.
- It provides the source code backend template to authenticate and authorize users by exposing RESTful APIs to do so.

## Features
- Username and password signup âœ”
- User and password login âœ”
- Account verification via email âœ”
- Public/open route example âœ”
- Route protection with expirable security tokens:
  - Via Autorization header as Bearer token âœ”
  - Via cookies âœ”
  - Via custom header keys ðŸ”œ
- Forgot password ðŸ”œ
- Change password ðŸ”œ
- User password expiration ðŸ”œ
- Account verification via SMS ðŸ”œ
- Authentication with Google ðŸ”œ

## Technologies and Techniques

### Project configuration
- The configuration variables are stored in a ```.env``` file. This file is managed by a configurator module to facilitate its usage across the other application modules by using the [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) library.
- The project architecture was implemented by enhancing the concepts of [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) to get a more robust architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Main application
- This project was implenmented 100% with Typescript, Nodejs and Express.
- Authentication is implemented with the [bcryptjs](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js) library for password encryption and the Local stategy from the [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) library.
- Authorization is done with JWT strategy from the Passport library.
- Tokenization is done with [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken).
- ```MongoDB``` and the ```mongoose``` ORM were used for the databse.
- Email service is handled with [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/) and using gmail as Email server for testing purposes.
- [Cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) and [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) were used to avoid well-known web vulnerabilities.
- [Compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) is being used for performance.

### Testing
- Unite Testing code coverage is 100%
- The unit testing is done with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
- [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) library is used to test the HTTP server.
- A MongoDB in memory server was used to perform a complete test with database interaction, this was possible with the [mongodb-memory-server](https://github.com/nodkz/mongodb-memory-server) library.
- [MailSlurp](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client) with a free account configuration was used to perform the Account email verification. 

## Setup
1. Clone this project by doing:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/pieroguerrero/auth-backend.git
```
2. Go to the folder you've just cloned the code and execute:
```
$ npm install
```
**WARNING:** If you are going to use other libraries to achieve other purposes be carefull and remove the caret (^) prefix that the dependency versions have.

3. Create a ```.env``` file in your project's container folder. The file should have the following variables with your own values:
```
#Node Enviromental variable used for performance purposes
NODE_ENV="development"

#APP/SERVER CONFIGS

#Port number to be used by the current application:
PORT="3000"

#DATABASE CONFIGS

#MongoDB full connection string:
MONGODB_URI="<your-own-value-here>"

#JWT TOKEN CONFIGS

#A value to be used as seed by the JWT jsonwebtoken library in order to sign the payload:
SECRET_TOKEN_KEY="<your-own-value-here>"
#Number of iterations for the encryption algotithm:
TOKE_SALT_LENGTH=10
#JWT token expiration time, expressed in seconds or a string describing a time span zeit/ms. Eg: 60, "2 days", "10h", "7d":
JWT_EXPIRATION_IN_SECONDS="<your-own-value-here>"
#When 'true', it will provide and receive the authorization token via the cookies. Otherwhise will handle it via Authorization header with a bearer token:
TOKEN_FROM_COOKIE="false"
#Useful only when TOKEN_FROM_COOKIE is 'true'. This parameter gives a name to the cookie is going to be used to provide and receive the authorization token:
JWT_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME="<your-own-value-here>"

#EMAIL CONFIGS

#Gmail Email host, commonly: 'smtp.gmail.com':
EMAIL_GMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
#Gmail email address to use used as the email sender:
EMAIL_GMAIL_ADDRESS="<your-own-value-here>"
#Gmail email sender password:
EMAIL_GMAIL_PASS="<your-own-value-here>"
#Secret key to perform Email Verification testing with Jest and Supertest. You can get one free at: https://mailslurp.com/
EMAIL_MAILSLURP_KEY="YOUR KEY HERE"

```

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Room for Improvement
There are always room for improvement, in this project so far the thinkgs that can be improved are:
- A separate web page for the Docs containing the API catalogs.
