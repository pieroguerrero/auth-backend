## General Information
- This project was created to fullfil the need several Software Engineers have when trying to create a Fullstack Web project from scratch.
- It provides the source code backend template to authenticate and authorize users by exposing RESTful APIs. It also secures the APIs with techniques such as Limiting the number of calls pero IP and delaying the calls reponse.

## Features
- Username and password signup âœ”
- User and password login âœ”
- Account verification via email âœ”
- Public/open route example âœ”
- Route protection with expirable security tokens:
  - Via Autorization header as Bearer token âœ”
  - Via cookies âœ”
  - Via custom header keys ðŸ”œ
- Forgot password ðŸ”œ
- Change password ðŸ”œ
- User password expiration ðŸ”œ
- Account verification via SMS ðŸ”œ
- Authentication with Google ðŸ”œ

## Technologies and Techniques

### Project configuration
- The configuration variables are stored in a ```.env``` file. This file is managed by a configurator module to facilitate its usage across the other application modules by using the [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) library.
- The project architecture was implemented by enhancing the concepts of [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) to get a more robust architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Main application
- This project was implenmented 100% with Typescript, Nodejs and Express.
- Authentication is implemented with the [bcryptjs](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js) library for password encryption and the Local stategy from the [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) library.
- Authorization is done with JWT strategy from the Passport library.
- Tokenization is done with [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken).
- ```MongoDB``` and the ```mongoose``` ORM were used for the databse.
- Email service is handled with [nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/) and using gmail as Email server for testing purposes.
- [Compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) is being used for performance.

### Security
- [Cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) and [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) were used to avoid well-known web vulnerabilities.
- The number of calls to the SignUp route is limited to avoid infinite calls that may block the internal resources, this was implemented with [express-rate-limit](https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit)
- Every SignUp route call from the same IP will have a delayed response to avoid bruteforce attacks. This is implemented with [express-slow-down](https://github.com/express-rate-limit/express-slow-down)


### Testing
- Unite Testing code coverage is 100%
- The unit testing is done with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
- [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) library is used to test the HTTP server.
- A MongoDB in memory server was used to perform a complete test with database interaction, this was possible with the [mongodb-memory-server](https://github.com/nodkz/mongodb-memory-server) library.
- [MailSlurp](https://github.com/mailslurp/mailslurp-client) with a free account configuration was used to perform the Account email verification:

## Setup
1. Clone this project by doing:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/pieroguerrero/auth-backend.git
```
2. Go to the folder you've just cloned the code and execute:
```
$ npm install
```
**WARNING:** If you are going to use other libraries to achieve other purposes be carefull and remove the caret (^) prefix that the dependency versions have.

3. Create a ```.env``` file in your project's container folder. The file should have the following variables with your own values:
```
#Node Enviromental variable used for performance purposes
NODE_ENV="development"

#APP/SERVER CONFIGS

#Port number to be used by the current application:
PORT="3000"

#DATABASE CONFIGS

#MongoDB full connection string:
MONGODB_URI="<your-own-value-here>"

#JWT TOKEN CONFIGS

#A value to be used as seed by the JWT jsonwebtoken library in order to sign the payload:
SECRET_TOKEN_KEY="<your-own-value-here>"
#Number of iterations for the encryption algotithm:
TOKE_SALT_LENGTH=10
#JWT token expiration time, expressed in seconds or a string describing a time span zeit/ms. Eg: 60, "2 days", "10h", "7d":
JWT_EXPIRATION_IN_SECONDS="<your-own-value-here>"
#When 'true', it will provide and receive the authorization token via the cookies. Otherwhise will handle it via Authorization header with a bearer token:
TOKEN_FROM_COOKIE="false"
#Useful only when TOKEN_FROM_COOKIE is 'true'. This parameter gives a name to the cookie is going to be used to provide and receive the authorization token:
JWT_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME="<your-own-value-here>"

#EMAIL CONFIGS

#Gmail Email host, commonly: 'smtp.gmail.com':
EMAIL_GMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
#Gmail email address to use used as the email sender:
EMAIL_GMAIL_ADDRESS="<your-own-value-here>"
#Gmail email sender password:
EMAIL_GMAIL_PASS="<your-own-value-here>"
#Secret key to perform Email Verification testing with Jest and Supertest. You can get one free at: https://mailslurp.com/
EMAIL_MAILSLURP_KEY="YOUR KEY HERE"

#API SECURE SETTINGS
#Establishes the time in milliseconds in wich an IP can make a certain number of calls
RATE_LIMIT_TIME_IN_MS="60000"
#Establishes the number of calls that can be made in the time set by RATE_LIMIT_TIME_IN_MS
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_CALLS="2"
#How long to keep records of requests in memory.
SPEED_LIMIT_TIME_WINDOW_IN_MS="30000"
#Max number of connections during SPEED_LIMIT_TIME_WINDOW_IN_MS before starting to delay responses. Defaults to 1. Set to 0 to disable delaying.
SPEED_LIMIT_DELAY_AFTER="1"
#How long to delay the response, multiplied by (number recent hits - SPEED_LIMIT_DELAY_AFTER). Defaults to 1000 (1 second). Set to 0 to disable delaying.
SPEE_LIMIT_DELAYING_TIME_IN_MS="500"

```

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Room for Improvement
There are always room for improvement, in this project so far the thinkgs that can be improved are:
- A separate web page for the Docs containing the API catalogs.
